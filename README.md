### Abstract:
Activation functions (AFs) play a pivotal role in the performance of  neural networks.
The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is currently the most commonly used AF. Several replacements to ReLU have been suggested but improvements have proven inconsistent. Some AFs exhibit better performance for specific tasks, but it is hard to know a priori how to select the appropriate one(s). Studying both standard fully connected neural networks (FCNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we propose a novel, three-population, coevolutionary algorithm to evolve AFs, and compare it to four other methods, both evolutionary and non-evolutionary. 
Tested on four datasets---MNIST, FashionMNIST, KMNIST, and USPS---coevolution proves to be a performant algorithm for finding good AFs and AF architectures.
